---

## Files Modified

### 1. Database Model
**File**: `src/db/models.py`

**Added 9 new columns to ClientResponse:**
```python
therapist_gender_preference = Column(String)
browser_timezone = Column(String)
insurance_provider_corrected = Column(Boolean, default=False)
algorithm_suggested_therapist_id = Column(String)
algorithm_suggested_therapist_name = Column(String)
algorithm_suggested_therapist_score = Column(Float)
alternative_therapists_offered = Column(JSON)
user_chose_alternative = Column(Boolean, default=False)
therapist_selection_timestamp = Column(DateTime)
```

### 2. Progressive Logger Service
**File**: `src/services/google_sheets_progressive_logger.py`

**Major Changes:**
- ❌ **Removed** old Stage 0 (Nirvana-only logging)
- ✅ **Added** new Stage 1 method: `log_stage_1_partial_submission()`
- ✅ **Refactored** Stage 2: `log_stage_2_survey_complete()` - now handles optional Nirvana
- ✅ **Enhanced** Stage 3: Added therapist selection tracking
- ✅ **Added** 15+ new headers to Google Sheets
- ✅ **Maintained** backward compatibility with alias methods

**New Stage Structure:**

| Stage | When | What's Logged | Nirvana |
|-------|------|---------------|---------|
| **1** | Email entered | email, first_name, session_id, UTM params | N/A |
| **2** | Survey complete | All survey data, preferences, matches | **Optional** (insurance only) |
| **3** | Appointment booked | Selected therapist, booking details | N/A |

### 3. API Endpoints

**File**: `src/api/clients.py`
- ✅ Added auto-detection for partial vs complete submissions
- ✅ Calls Stage 1 for email-only submissions
- ✅ Calls Stage 2 for complete survey submissions

**File**: `src/api/therapists.py`
- ✅ Stores `algorithm_suggested_therapist_id` (#1 match)
- ✅ Stores `alternative_therapists_offered` as JSON
- ✅ Updates comprehensive_data for Google Sheets logging

**File**: `src/api/appointments.py`
- ✅ Compares selected vs suggested therapist
- ✅ Sets `user_chose_alternative` flag
- ✅ Records `therapist_selection_timestamp`
- ✅ Logs comprehensive Stage 3 data

### 4. Database Migration
**File**: `migrations/versions/add_progressive_logger_fields.py`

- ✅ Created Alembic migration for all 9 new columns
- ✅ Includes upgrade and downgrade functions
- ✅ Safe to run on production database

### 5. Documentation
**Files Created:**
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step Railway deployment instructions
- ✅ `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Partial Submission Tracking (Stage 1)
**Problem Solved**: Previously, users who entered email but didn't complete the survey were never tracked.

**Solution**: Stage 1 now captures partial submissions immediately when email is entered.

**Data Captured**:
- Email, first_name
- Session ID
- UTM parameters (source, medium, campaign)
- Technical metadata (user_agent, screen_resolution, browser_timezone)

**Impact**: Can now analyze drop-off rates and follow up with incomplete users.

---

### 2. Algorithm Performance Analytics
**Problem Solved**: No visibility into whether users chose the algorithm's #1 suggestion or picked an alternative.

**Solution**: Track and compare algorithm's suggestion vs user's actual selection.

**Data Captured**:
- `algorithm_suggested_therapist_id` - Algorithm's #1 pick
- `algorithm_suggested_therapist_name`
- `algorithm_suggested_therapist_score` - Match score
- `alternative_therapists_count` - How many options shown
- `alternative_therapists_names` - Comma-separated list
- `user_chose_alternative` - Boolean flag
- `therapist_selection_timestamp`

**Impact**: Can measure algorithm effectiveness and improve matching logic.

---

### 3. Optional Nirvana Flow
**Problem Solved**: Old Stage 0 required Nirvana verification, blocking cash-pay users.

**Solution**: Nirvana is now optional in Stage 2 - only runs for insurance users.

**Logic**:
```python
if payment_type == "insurance":
    # Run Nirvana verification
    # Log insurance data
else:  # cash_pay
    # Skip Nirvana
    # Proceed directly to matching
```

**Impact**: Cleaner flow for cash-pay users, no unnecessary API calls.

---

### 4. Insurance Correction Tracking
**Problem Solved**: When Nirvana corrects a user's insurance provider, we weren't tracking this.

**Solution**: New fields track correction events.

**Data Captured**:
- `insurance_provider_original` - What user selected
- `insurance_provider_corrected` - Boolean flag
- `insurance_correction_type` - Type of correction

**Impact**: Monitor Nirvana validation accuracy and identify common user errors.

✅ **`async_log_stage_1()`** - Updated to call new Stage 1 partial method
✅ **`async_log_stage_2()`** - Updated to call new Stage 2 complete method

### Breaking Changes:
⚠️ None! All existing code continues to work.

## Analytics Queries You Can Now Run

### 1. Algorithm Effectiveness
```sql
-- How often do users choose the algorithm's #1 suggestion?
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE user_chose_alternative = FALSE) as chose_suggested,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE user_chose_alternative = TRUE) as chose_alternative,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE user_chose_alternative = FALSE) / COUNT(*), 2) as accuracy_percentage
FROM client_responses
WHERE algorithm_suggested_therapist_id IS NOT NULL;
```

### 2. Drop-Off Analysis
```sql
-- Where do users drop off in the funnel?
SELECT
  'Stage 1 (Email)' as stage,
  COUNT(*) as users
FROM client_responses
WHERE email IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT
  'Stage 2 (Survey)' as stage,
  COUNT(*) as users
FROM client_responses
WHERE phq9_total IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT
  'Stage 3 (Booked)' as stage,
  COUNT(*) as users
FROM client_responses
WHERE match_status = 'booked';
```

### 3. Alternative Therapist Analysis
```sql
-- Which users were offered the most alternatives?
SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  email,
  alternative_therapists_offered->>'count' as alternatives_count,
  algorithm_suggested_therapist_name as suggested,
  selected_therapist_name as chosen,
  user_chose_alternative
FROM client_responses
WHERE alternative_therapists_offered IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY (alternative_therapists_offered->>'count')::int DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### 4. Insurance Corrections
```sql
-- How often does Nirvana correct insurance providers?
SELECT
  insurance_provider_original,
  COUNT(*) as times_corrected
FROM client_responses
WHERE insurance_provider_corrected = TRUE
GROUP BY insurance_provider_original
ORDER BY times_corrected DESC;
```

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, test:

- [ ] Partial submission creates Stage 1 row in Google Sheets
- [ ] Complete submission creates/updates Stage 2 row with survey data
- [ ] Insurance users get Nirvana data in Stage 2
- [ ] Cash-pay users skip Nirvana but still complete Stage 2
- [ ] Therapist matching stores algorithm suggestions
- [ ] Alternative therapists are stored as JSON
- [ ] Appointment booking tracks selected vs suggested therapist
- [ ] `user_chose_alternative` correctly identifies when user picks different therapist
- [ ] Stage 3 updates same row with booking data
- [ ] All 15+ new columns appear in Google Sheets
- [ ] Data preservation works (Stage 1 → 2 → 3 doesn't lose data)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Async Logging
All Google Sheets logging happens **asynchronously** to avoid blocking API responses:
- Stage 1: Async after email submission
- Stage 2: Async after survey completion
- Stage 3: Async after booking

### Database Indexes
Consider adding indexes for new query patterns:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_algorithm_suggested ON client_responses(algorithm_suggested_therapist_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_chose_alternative ON client_responses(user_chose_alternative);
CREATE INDEX idx_selection_timestamp ON client_responses(therapist_selection_timestamp);
```

### Google Sheets Rate Limits
- Current: 100 requests per 100 seconds per user
- Implementation uses batching to minimize API calls
- Async execution prevents blocking user flow

## Questions & Support

**Q: Will this break existing data?**
A: No, migration only adds new columns. Existing data is preserved.

**Q: What happens to users mid-flow when we deploy?**
A: They'll continue on old flow, new flow starts with next submission.

**Q: Can we rollback if needed?**
A: Yes, `alembic downgrade -1` removes new columns. Code is backward compatible.

**Q: How do I know if it's working?**
A: Check Railway logs for success messages like "✅ Stored algorithm suggestions" and "📊 [STAGE X] logging".
